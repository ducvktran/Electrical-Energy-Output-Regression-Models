# Electrical-Energy-Output-Regression-Models
In this notebook, some machine learning models are built to predict the electrical energy output of a combined cycle power plant based on ambient environmental characteristics.  Several regression models are built, and their performances are evaluated by calculating output metrics such as mean squared error and R squared.
